        The history of Bihar is one of the most varied in India. Bihar consists of three distinct regions,
         each has its own distinct history and culture. They are Magadha, Mithila and Bhojpur.
         [1] Chirand, on the northern bank of the Ganga River, in Saran district,
          has an archaeological record dating from the Neolithic age (c. 2500 - 1345 BC).
          [2][3] Regions of Bihar—such as Magadha, Mithila and Anga—are mentioned in religious texts and epics
           of ancient India. Mithila is believed to be the centre of Indian power in the Later Vedic period
            (c. 1100 - 500 BC). Mithila first gained prominence after the establishment of the ancient Videha \
            Kingdom.[4] The kings of the Videha were called Janakas. A daughter of one of the Janaks of Mithila, 
            Sita, is mentioned as consort of Lord Rama in the Hindu epic Ramayana.[5] The kingdom later became
             incorporated into the Vajjika League which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is also in
              Mithila.
