    <p>The history of Bihar is one of the most varied in India. Bihar consists 
        of three distinct regions, each has its own distinct history and culture.
         They are Magadha, Mithila and Bhojpur.[1] Chirand, on the northern bank of the Ganga River,
          in Saran district, has an archaeological record dating from the Neolithic age
           (c. 2500 - 1345 BC).[2][3] Regions of Bihar—such as Magadha, Mithila and Anga—are mentioned
            in religious texts and epics of ancient India. Mithila is believed to be the centre of 
            Indian power in the Later Vedic period (c. 1100 - 500 BC). Mithila first gained prominence 
            after the establishment of the ancient Videha Kingdom.[4] The kings of the Videha
             were called Janakas. A daughter of one of the Janaks of Mithila, Sita, is mentioned 
             as consort of Lord Rama in the Hindu epic Ramayana.[5] The kingdom later became incorporated 
             into the Vajjika League which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is 
             also in Mithila.[6]</p>
